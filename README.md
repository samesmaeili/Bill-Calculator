# Bill-Calculator
Bill calculator to determine how much an individual must pay for a shared group expense

Problem to be solved:
A common use case for this calculator is a restaurant bill, where one person pays for the whole group.
Generally, people at a restaurant will order different items that will vary in price. 
On top of that, tip, tax and sometimes a mandate fee are added on top of the bill.
These additional fees placed on top of the items ordered, make it difficult to calculate how much each individual owes.
This calculator was created to solve this problem.

Solution:
A user will enter the price of the items they bought into the calculator.
The user will also enter the tip, tax, and mandate percentage into the calculator.
If the user does not know any of the percentages mentioned, there are calculators that have been created to calculate those percentages.
